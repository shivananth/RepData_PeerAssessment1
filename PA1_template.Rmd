# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1
This document contains the solution to the Peer Assessment 1 of Reproducible Research course with all the necessary code and figures.

## Loading and preprocessing the data
Here's the code to read the csc file containinjg the activity data:
```{r}
activityData <- read.csv("C:/Users/GALAXY COMPUTERS/RepData_PeerAssessment1/activity/activity.csv")
```
Since the date variable is not of "date" type, let's coerce it.
```{r}
activityData$dateEdt <- as.Date(as.character(activityData$date))
```



## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
